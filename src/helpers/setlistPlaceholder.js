export const setlistPlaceholder = `There are only three rules: 

1. Make sure you separate songs with either a comma, >, or ->
This symbols > means one song stops and another immediately starts.
This symbol -> means the songs fluidly transition into each other. 

2. Begin each set with Set 1:, Set 2:, Set 3:, or Encore:
The colons are important to remember and those are the only options. 

3. Before you add any notes make sure you start with notes:

Here's an example:

Set 1: Daniel Saw the Stone, Golgi Apparatus, My Friend, My Friend[1], Ya Mar, Buried Alive > Fast Enough for You > All Things Reconsidered, Nellie Kane, Horn > Run Like an Antelope**

Set 2: Also Sprach Zarathustra$ > Split Open and Melt, Glide > Maze, Bouncing Around the Room, You Enjoy Myself -> Yerushalayim Shel Zahav$ -> You Enjoy Myself, Poor Heart, Purple Rain$ > Hold Your Head Up, Harry Hood, Cavern
